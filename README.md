# Data Broadcasting Project with nRF24L01 Module

This project aims to create a data broadcasting system using the nRF24L01 transceiver module for wireless transmission and reception. It includes a web interface on the transmitter side to control and manage the broadcasting process.

## Features

- Utilizes the nRF24L01 module for reliable wireless communication.
- Transmitter side equipped with the nRF24L01 module for data transmission.
- Receivers equipped with the nRF24L01 module for data reception.
- Web interface on the transmitter side for easy control and management.
- Efficient dissemination of data to multiple receivers.
- Real-time monitoring and control of the broadcasting process.
- Seamless integration into various applications.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Arduino IDE (or any compatible IDE)
- nRF24L01 library (install via Arduino Library Manager)

### Hardware Setup

1. Connect the nRF24L01 module to the transmitter Arduino board.
2. Connect the nRF24L01 module to the receiver Arduino board(s).

### Software Setup

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Open the transmitter and receiver sketches in Arduino IDE.
3. Configure the necessary settings (e.g., transmission address, data rate) in the sketches.
4. Upload the sketches to the respective Arduino boards.

## Usage

1. Power on the transmitter and receiver devices.
2. Access the web interface on the transmitter side through a web browser.
3. Use the web interface to control and manage the data broadcasting process.
4. The transmitted data will be received by the nRF24L01 modules on the receiver side.
